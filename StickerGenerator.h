/*
 * Generates "stickers", which are pictures of basic, single, un-timestamped chat messages and associated user Avatars.
 * Called statically through its sole public method `generate()`.
 * The visual style is roughly modeled after how Telegram's looks, though it doesn't use a real client's algorithms.
 * The implementation is very heavily inspired by https://github.com/LyoSU/quote-api and mimics its interfaces. Roughly.
 * Under the hood, we have different tools available to us, so it ends up working a little differently and I had to
 * make a few fun choices and reimplement most of the solutions.
 * I hope I've done it justice :-)
 *
 * The upstream code does more stuff, is better tested, and produces more faithful mockups of telegram messages.
 * If you wanna see that in action, and you have telegram, check out @QuotLyBot - it's fun.
 * This is a port for a specific usecase, and here are some of the aims:
 * 1. More reliable (here). The original code ""goes to sleep"" if unused for a while, and fails its next request.
 *      I probably broke something when I installed it; I had to make a few tiny changes.
 *      I should check that out, hmmmm. Maybe the avatar caching's async functionality?
 * 2. Less memory pressure (here).
 *      My executable is 107KB right now (on disk, when stripped) and uses shared libraries already loaded.
 *      The original is using over 300MB of RAM right now, just idling.
 *      And there's a recommendation to use it with docker, on top of that.
 * 3. Less disk usage. Not a big deal, but the original needs 294MB of node_modules installed.
 *      AND they recommend using it with docker, on top of that.
 *      Mine uses whatever's lying around (if you have Qt5 in your libs path).
 *      But these days, that figure is nothing, even at home, so meh.
 * 4. Less network use
 *      The original needs a Telegram bot API key and selects the user's icon by itself.
 *      Mine assumes that you already have the user's icon, and just fetches that.
 *      I did hope that mine would run faster, but that's not proven.
 *      If used as part of a larger application (eg a long running server like the original) it SHOULD go faster,
 *      particularly if used behind/with a network cache.
 *
 * Theirs is designed to sit there and run at full speed 24/7 - and it does a great job.
 * Always running, never crashes, results always look great!
 * Mine is only very lightly used, at least in my case, and is intended for a much smaller purpose right now.
 *
 * If you want it battle-tested and fully featured, you do not want my stripped down implementation, you want upstream.
